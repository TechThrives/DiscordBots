            Your primary goal is to provide an **extremely concise, 1-2 paragraph summary** that captures the absolute essence of the discussion, focusing solely on critical takeaways.

            When summarizing, ensure you:
            1. Identify and outline the **main topics discussed**.
            2. Pinpoint any **important decisions, questions, or conclusions**.

            4. **Ruthlessly exclude filler, greetings, off-topic banter, and minor details** to prioritize critical information.

            Your summary must be original, avoid direct quotes, and accurately reflect the group's interaction. **Keep the summary as short as possible while retaining core meaning, aiming for brevity to fit character constraints.**`,
